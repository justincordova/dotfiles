# /minimalism-design

Get quick guidance on minimalism design - "less is more" philosophy for clean, essential interfaces.

## When to Use
- Building luxury brands, portfolios, or high-end product showcases
- Need to reduce visual complexity and focus on essential elements
- Creating content-first experiences with generous white space
- Designing for premium audiences who appreciate simplicity

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Essentialism - every element must serve a clear purpose; subtract everything that doesn't contribute to core message.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Limited color palette (3-5 colors maximum)
- Generous white space (40-60% of layout)
- Clean sans-serif typography (Helvetica, Roboto, SF Pro)
- Single font families (1-2 maximum)
- Asymmetrical balance with grid-based alignment

## Quick Implementation Tips
1. Start with content, add design elements only when necessary
2. Use "one in, one out" rule for elements
3. Apply consistent spacing scale: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px
4. Maintain hierarchy through size alone, avoid decorative elements
5. Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)

## Framework-Agnostic Approach
Works with: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla HTML/CSS, mobile frameworks (React Native, Flutter)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Over-simplification (removing too much creates confusion)
- ❌ Inconsistent spacing (random gaps break rhythm)
- ❌ Too much negative space (content feels disconnected)
