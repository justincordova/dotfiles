# Minimalism Design

## Core Principle
Essentialism - every element must serve a clear purpose; subtract everything that doesn't contribute to core message.

## When to Apply
- Symptom: Overcrowded interfaces, visual clutter, competing elements
- Use case: Luxury brands, portfolios, architectural sites, product showcases
- Context: Premium audiences, high-end products, content-first experiences

## Visual Characteristics
**Typography:** Clean sans-serif (Helvetica, Roboto, SF Pro), limited 1-2 font families, generous letter-spacing, large bold headlines for hierarchy

**Color:** Limited palette (3-5 colors max), neutral backgrounds (white, light gray, black), monochromatic or analogous schemes, one or two accent colors maximum

**Spacing:** Generous white space (40-60% of layout), consistent grid systems (4px/8px/16px baselines), modular scale margins/padding, air between elements

**Layout:** Asymmetrical balance, grid-based alignment, centralized or off-center focal points, minimal navigation, single-column on mobile

**Motion:** Subtle, purposeful animations, smooth transitions (200-500ms), scroll-triggered reveals, hover states that surprise without overwhelming

## Implementation Guidelines
### Technical Considerations
- Start with content, add design elements only when necessary
- Use "one in, one out" rule for elements
- Maintain strong visual hierarchy through scale alone
- Ensure accessibility with high contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
- Progressive enhancement for functionality
- Use CSS variables for consistent spacing: `--space-xs: 4px`, `--space-md: 16px`, `--space-xl: 32px`

### Quick Reference
| Element | Guideline |
|---------|----------|
| Color palette | 3-5 colors maximum |
| Font families | 1-2 families max |
| White space | 40-60% of layout |
| Touch targets | 44x44px minimum |
| Contrast ratio | 4.5:1 minimum (WCAG AA) |

## Common Mistakes
- ❌ Over-simplification: Removing too much creates confusion and lacks hierarchy
- ✅ Strategic reduction: Keep essential elements that guide users through content

- ❌ Inconsistent spacing: Random gaps break visual rhythm
- ✅ Modular scales: Use 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px consistently

- ❌ Too much negative space: Content feels disconnected
- ✅ Balanced spacing: Generous but maintains visual relationships
