# Swiss Style / International Typographic Style

## Core Principle
Mathematical precision - objective communication through grids, typography, and calculated spacing.

## When to Apply
- Symptom: Editorial layouts, typography-driven designs, mathematical precision needed
- Use case: Corporate identities, magazines, newspapers, branding systems, signage
- Context: Clear, direct, unambiguous communication prioritized

## Visual Characteristics
**Typography:** Sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Univers), multiple weights (light to bold), consistent sizing scale (6pt-72pt), clear visual hierarchy, tight tracking/kerning for headlines, left-aligned text (rarely centered)

**Layout:** Mathematical grids (modular grids, column systems), asymmetric balance, negative space as design element, strong vertical rhythms, grid-based alignment, left-aligned content

**Color:** Limited palettes (2-4 colors), high contrast (black/white with accent), color used strategically for emphasis, process colors (CMYK) for print, neutral backgrounds

**Shapes:** Geometric forms (circles, rectangles, triangles), clean lines and edges, minimal decoration, symbolic shapes (arrows, icons), scale-based relationships

**Photography:** Object photography, studio lighting, clean backgrounds, high contrast, strategic cropping

**Motion:** Minimal, purposeful, functional

## Implementation Guidelines
### Technical Considerations
- Modular grid: 12-column system with consistent gutters (24px)
- Type scale: 6pt, 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 16pt, 20pt, 24pt, 30pt, 36pt, 48pt, 60pt, 72pt
- Font family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
- Line height: 1.2-1.5 for body text, tighter for headlines
- Left alignment: `text-align: left;` for all content
- Margin/padding: Follow grid system consistently
- Negative space: Embrace generous whitespace as element
- Hierarchy: Size and weight create clear structure
- Grid columns: Use `grid-column: span X` consistently
- Mathematical proportions: Golden ratio, modular scale for sizing
- Accessibility: High contrast ratios (7:1 for large text, 4.5:1 for body)
- International: Support multiple languages and character sets

### Quick Reference
| Element | Guideline |
|---------|----------|
| Font family | Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif |
| Alignment | Left-aligned (never centered) |
| Grid | Modular 12-column, 24px gutters |
| Color palette | 2-4 colors maximum |
| Type scale | 6pt-72pt modular scale |
| Line height | 1.2-1.5 (body), tighter (headlines) |
| Negative space | Generous, treated as element |
| Contrast | High (7:1 large, 4.5:1 body) |

## Common Mistakes
- ❌ Too rigid: Design becomes boring and predictable
- ✅ Mathematical but flexible: Grid guides, doesn't constrain creativity

- ❌ Poor readability at small sizes: Tight tracking hurts legibility
- ✅ Balance precision: Careful kerning for headlines, relaxed for body

- ❌ Centered alignment: Violates Swiss principles
- ✅ Left-aligned: Consistent, professional, readable
