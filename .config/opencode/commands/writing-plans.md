## When to Use
- Have a spec or requirements for implementation
- Multi-step task that needs planning
- Before writing any code
- After design is approved from brainstorming

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Plan before implement. Document the path before walking it.

**Process:**
1. Understand requirements or spec
2. Break down into tasks and subtasks
3. Identify dependencies
4. Write detailed implementation plan
5. Get plan approval
6. Transition to execution

## Key Principles
- Write plans before touching code
- Break down complex tasks
- Identify dependencies
- Document approach
- Get approval before implementing

## Plan Structure
- Overview of what to build
- Breakdown into tasks
- Task dependencies
- Implementation approach
- Verification strategy

## Anti-Pattern
- "I'll just start coding"
- Skipping planning for "simple" tasks
- No written plan, just mental notes
