# /using-superpowers

Find and use skills for specific tasks. Superpowers provide specialized workflows for different development activities.

## When to Use
- Starting any conversation - establishes how to find and use skills
- Need to determine which skill applies to your task
- Want to learn about available skills

## Quick Overview

**The Rule:** Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action. Even a 1% chance means invoke the skill.

**Skill Priority:**
1. Process skills first (brainstorming, debugging) - determine HOW to approach
2. Implementation skills second (frontend-design, etc.) - guide execution

**Available Skills:**

**Process Skills:**
- `brainstorming` - Before any creative work
- `systematic-debugging` - Before any bug fix
- `test-driven-development` - Before any implementation
- `writing-plans` - Before touching code with spec/requirements
- `verification-before-completion` - Before claiming work is complete
- `receiving-code-review` - Before implementing review feedback

**Execution Skills:**
- `executing-plans` - Execute written implementation plans
- `subagent-driven-development` - Execute with independent parallel tasks
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` - Handle 2+ independent tasks
- `finishing-a-development-branch` - Complete and integrate work
- `requesting-code-review` - Get feedback before merging
- `using-git-worktrees` - Create isolated development environments

**Creation Skills:**
- `writing-skills` - Create or edit skills

## Key Principles
- Check skills FIRST, before any action
- 1% chance applies = MUST use it
- Not optional, not negotiable
- Skills evolve - read current version

## Red Flags
- "This is just a simple question"
- "I need more context first"
- "I can check git/files quickly"
- "The skill is overkill"
- "I remember this skill"
- "This doesn't count as a task"
