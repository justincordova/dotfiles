Get quick guidance on Swiss style design - mathematical precision and typography for editorial layouts.

## When to Use
- Building editorial layouts, corporate identities, or branding systems
- Creating magazines, newspapers, or typography-driven designs
- Need mathematical precision and clear visual hierarchy
- Designing signage, packaging, or communication systems

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Mathematical precision - objective communication through grids, typography, and calculated spacing.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Sans-serif fonts (Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk, Univers)
- Mathematical grids (modular grids, column systems)
- Limited color palettes (2-4 colors)
- Left-aligned text (rarely centered)
- High contrast (black/white with accent)

## Quick Implementation Tips
1. Modular grid: 12-column system with 24px gutters
2. Type scale: 6pt, 8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 16pt, 20pt, 24pt, 30pt, 36pt, 48pt, 60pt, 72pt
3. Font family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
4. Line height: 1.2-1.5 for body text, tighter for headlines
5. Left alignment: `text-align: left;` for all content
6. Margin/padding: Follow grid system consistently
7. Negative space: Embrace generous whitespace as design element
8. Hierarchy: Size and weight create clear structure
9. Grid columns: Use `grid-column: span X` consistently

## Framework-Agnostic Approach
Works with: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla CSS/HTML, print design, web design, any framework

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Too rigid (design becomes boring and predictable)
- ❌ Poor readability at small sizes (tight tracking hurts legibility)
- ❌ Centered alignment (violates Swiss principles)
