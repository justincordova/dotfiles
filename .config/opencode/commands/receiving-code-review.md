# /receiving-code-review

When receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions. Requires technical rigor and verification, not performative agreement or blind implementation.

## When to Use
- Received code review feedback
- Feedback seems unclear or technically questionable
- Need to implement review suggestions carefully

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Technical rigor over performative agreement. Verify, don't blindly implement.

**Process:**
1. Understand the feedback
2. Verify technical merit
3. Question if unclear
4. Implement with understanding
5. Verify changes work

## Key Principles
- Don't blindly implement suggestions
- Verify technical correctness
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Implement only with understanding
- Test changes thoroughly

## Anti-Pattern
Performative agreement - implementing suggestions without understanding or verifying.
