Get quick guidance on corporate clean/SaaS design - trust through consistency for enterprise interfaces.

## When to Use
- Building enterprise SaaS applications, dashboards, or admin panels
- Creating project management tools, developer platforms, or analytics interfaces
- Need professional, trustworthy aesthetics
- Designing for business users who value consistency and scalability

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Trust through consistency - uniform elements create reliability and scalability across complex interfaces.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Neutral color bases (#000000, #FFFFFF, #F5F5F5)
- Trust colors (blue #007AFF, green #28A745)
- 8px grid system (multiples of 8)
- Dense but readable information density
- Professional sans-serif typography (Inter, system-ui, IBM Plex)

## Quick Implementation Tips
1. Use 8px baseline grid for all spacing (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px)
2. Create documented component library (Storybook for visual docs)
3. Implement 12-column grid with 24px gutters
4. Sidebar navigation: 240-280px width
5. Form validation with inline messages and 1px focus rings (2px on focus)
6. 16px minimum touch targets for interactive elements

## Framework-Agnostic Approach
Works with: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, vanilla HTML/CSS, mobile frameworks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Too sterile (lacks personality)
- ❌ Inconsistent components (similar elements look different)
- ❌ Poor data density (too much whitespace reduces efficiency)
