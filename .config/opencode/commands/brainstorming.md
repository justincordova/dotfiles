# /brainstorming

Explore user intent, requirements and design before implementation. Turn ideas into fully formed designs through collaborative dialogue.

## When to Use
- Before any creative work (features, components, functionality, behavior changes)
- Need to understand what to build before writing code
- Exploring different approaches with trade-offs

## Quick Overview

**Core Principle:** Understand before building. Every project needs design, even "simple" ones.

**Process:**
1. Explore project context
2. Ask clarifying questions (one at a time)
3. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
4. Present design and get approval
5. Write design document
6. Transition to writing-plans skill

## Key Principles
- One question at a time - don't overwhelm
- Multiple choice preferred when possible
- YAGNI ruthlessly - remove unnecessary features
- Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- Incremental validation - present design, get approval before moving on

## Anti-Pattern
"This is too simple to need a design" - unexamined assumptions cause wasted work. Design can be short, but you MUST present it and get approval.
